# Rust platform support in Tree

Rust platform support in Tree is a single page application to visualize rust platform, built with [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

### Start Static Webserver

For example, by using the `PHP` one:

```bash
php -S localhost:4000
```

Or the `Python` one:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4000
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:4000/.

## Data description file

The `data.json` file describes your platform in a json format.
